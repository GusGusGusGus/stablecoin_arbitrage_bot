        <h3>1. Connecting</h3>
        <p>
            Configure RPC endpoints and contract addresses in <strong>config/appsettings.json</strong>. Use the wallet login button to
            verify operator status before executing runs.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Running Strategies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>On-Demand</strong>: Executes a single opportunity. Provide calldata or let the scanner detect live spreads.</li>
            <li><strong>Loop Mode</strong>: Continuously scans and executes while profitable. Cancel anytime from the Run page.</li>
            <li><strong>Backtest</strong>: Replays stored snapshots to validate strategy risk parameters and fee settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Risk Parameters</h3>
        <p>
            Minimum profit, execution ceilings, and sandwich buffers are defined in the risk section of the configuration file.
            Use the Stats page to evaluate whether the guardrails require tuning.
        </p>

        <h3>4. App Fees</h3>
        <p>
            A 5% application fee can be collected to the designated revenue wallet. The feature is implemented but disabled by
            default and surfaced as a read-only preview in the dashboard.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Cancellation Workflow</h3>
        <p>
            Every run passes a linked cancellation token. Trigger "Cancel Current" to immediately unwind the active run while
            preserving the background worker for future jobs.
